## Problem Statement:
The jewelry industry, particularly the segment involving traditional and heritage designs, faces significant challenges in the digital age. Triveni Jewelers, a reputed name in traditional and modern jewelry, currently lacks a robust online presence, which limits their reach to potential customers who prefer online shopping due to convenience, wider selection, and the ability to compare prices and designs effortlessly. This absence of an e-commerce platform not only hinders their ability to tap into a broader market but also affects customer engagement and sales conversion rates.
